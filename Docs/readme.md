MIX5R Pro is a MIDI-enabled USB device for music, audio and more.  

## Features

## How-To

Instructions for getting started and configuring the device.

### DAWs and Other Software

Most DAWs have a mapping feature to automatically learn MIDI controls as they are moved. If your DAW or other software has this, it should be compatible. Activate your software's learning feature and move each fader sequentially.

### Fader Settings

This is primarily for MIDI settings (CC & channel) but can also be used with Deej for limiting or reversing fader output.
