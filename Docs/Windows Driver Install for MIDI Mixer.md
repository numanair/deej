# Windows Driver Install for MIDI Mixer

These steps are only required for Windows. Mac and Linux do not require an additional driver.

1. Download the .zip from this GitHub: https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32  
Click the **green "Code" button** and then click "Download ZIP".
2. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a temporary folder.
3. Open the `Drivers` folder within the extracted files. Open the `win` folder within that.
4. Run the `install_drivers.bat` file. It will ask for admin permissions. Give it time to complete. Once it is done your Mixer is ready to go!
5. You can now delete the downloaded ZIP as well as the extracted folders if you wish.
